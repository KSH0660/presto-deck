## About The Project

Creating compelling presentations is time-consuming. You have to structure the narrative, write the content, find the right visuals, and design each slide. **Presto automates this entire process.**

By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Presto understands your topic, builds a logical story flow, writes the content for each slide, and matches it with the best visual layout. The result is a ready-to-use presentation delivered as clean HTML that you can edit directly in your browser.

### Core Features

  * **ü§ñ AI-Powered Content:** Generate a complete presentation outline and content from a single topic.
  * **üé® Smart Layouts:** Automatically selects the best slide template for your content (e.g., title, list, image with text).
  * **‚úèÔ∏è In-Browser Editing:** Instantly edit text on your generated slides without needing any special software.
  * **üöÄ Built with a Modern Stack:** Powered by Python, FastAPI, and the Gemini API for a fast and scalable backend.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Presto server running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.10+
  * A virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/presto.git
    cd presto
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can copy the example file to get started:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, open the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Run the FastAPI server:**

    ```sh
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

The API will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
