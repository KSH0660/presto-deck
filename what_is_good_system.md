 Concise Summary of Good System Design
Keep it simple: Good designs don’t look complex and run without frequent issues.

State management is hardest: Minimize stateful components; centralize state in the database.

Database first: Focus on schema, indexing, and reducing bottlenecks before adding caching or other optimizations.

Be cautious with caching & events: Cache only when necessary; prefer simple request–response over excessive eventing.

Separate fast vs. slow tasks: User-facing requests must be quick; long tasks go to background jobs.

Focus on hot paths: Critical flows deserve the most design/testing effort.

Observability matters: Log failures, monitor CPU/memory, and track tail latencies (p95/p99).

Failure handling: Use kill switches, circuit breakers, retries with idempotency; choose fail-open vs. fail-closed wisely.

Boring is good: Stable systems come from proven, simple methods—not flashy complexity.
